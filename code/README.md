# Business Site

Build a business site with a responsive hero image. The site should contain a sign-up form which posts the information to httpbin. The form should contain at least three different input types. The site should also contain an accordion built with java script. 


## The problem

I started by choosing an image and then came up with my idea for the rest of the page. This week I have thanked it very slowly in the various steps, and I started with the html structure then the java script and finally styling. I have also always tried to understand my code and care less about the page looking good. Before I started I looked through and read all the material that came with the assignment. During the time I built my page, I also watched the recorded videos from code sessions and coded along. This week I have also googled for answers much more than last week and asked questions to them in the team and on stackoverflow. If I had had more time I would also have done the red level, and really understand how the responsivness works.
